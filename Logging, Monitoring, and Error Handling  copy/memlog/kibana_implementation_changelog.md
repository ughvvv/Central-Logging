# Kibana Implementation Changelog

## Date: 2025-03-25

### Changes Made

1. **Created Metricbeat Configuration**
   - Created `metricbeat.yml` to collect metrics from Prometheus
   - Configured it to send metrics to Elastic Cloud

2. **Created Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Created `docker-compose.kibana.yml` with Metricbeat service
   - Removed Grafana service as Kibana will be used instead

3. **Created Run Script**
   - Created `run_kibana_infrastructure.sh` to start the infrastructure with Kibana
   - Made the script executable with `chmod +x`

4. **Created Documentation**
   - Created `KIBANA_VISUALIZATION_GUIDE.md` with detailed instructions for using Kibana
   - Included information on setting up index patterns, creating visualizations, and creating dashboards

5. **Created Sample Dashboards**
   - Created `kibana_sample_dashboards.ndjson` with sample dashboards for logs and metrics
   - Included Log Analysis Dashboard, Metrics Dashboard, and Operational Overview Dashboard

### Purpose

The purpose of these changes was to transition from Grafana to Kibana as the primary visualization tool for the logging, monitoring, and error handling infrastructure. This approach:

1. Leverages the existing Elastic Cloud setup
2. Provides a unified view of logs and metrics in Kibana
3. Eliminates the need to deal with Grafana authentication issues

### Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Metricbeat collects metrics from Prometheus
   - Metrics are sent to Elastic Cloud Elasticsearch
   - Metrics are stored in the `metricbeat-*` index pattern

2. **Visualization**
   - Sample dashboards are provided for logs and metrics
   - Detailed documentation is provided for creating custom visualizations and dashboards

3. **Infrastructure**
   - A dedicated Docker Compose file is provided for running the infrastructure with Kibana
   - A run script is provided for starting the infrastructure and opening Kibana

### Security Considerations

- This implementation uses the existing Elastic Cloud credentials
- Kibana access is secured with username/password authentication
- No changes were made to the security configuration of the infrastructure

### Testing

The changes can be tested using the provided run script:
- `./run_kibana_infrastructure.sh`

This script will start the infrastructure and open Kibana in the default browser.

### Next Steps

To fully transition to Kibana:
1. Import the sample dashboards
2. Create index patterns for logs and metrics
3. Create custom visualizations and dashboards as needed
4. Set up alerts for important metrics and log patterns
