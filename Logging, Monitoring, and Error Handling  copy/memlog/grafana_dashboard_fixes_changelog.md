# Grafana Dashboard Fixes Changelog

## 2025-03-30: Fixed Test Agent Dashboard Visualization Issues

### Issue
The Test Agent Dashboard in Grafana was not properly displaying data in the Event Types and Log Severity panels. The panels were showing "No data" despite logs being present in Elasticsearch.

### Root Cause
The dashboard was using the analyzed versions of string fields (`event_type` and `severity`) for aggregations in Elasticsearch, which doesn't work well for aggregation queries. Elasticsearch dynamically maps string fields as both analyzed text fields and non-analyzed keyword fields (with a `.keyword` suffix).

### Changes Made
1. Updated the Test Agent Dashboard JSON configuration to use the `.keyword` suffix for string fields in aggregations:
   - Changed `event_type` to `event_type.keyword` in the Event Types panel
   - Changed `severity` to `severity.keyword` in the Log Severity panel

2. Extended the time range in the dashboard from 6 hours to 7 days to ensure logs were visible in the selected time period.

3. Created documentation in `memlog/elasticsearch_field_mapping.md` explaining Elasticsearch field mapping and best practices for Grafana dashboards.

### Validation
After making these changes, the dashboard was tested and all panels now display data correctly:
- The Test Agent Log Count panel shows log counts over time
- The Test Agent Logs panel shows the actual log entries
- The Event Types panel shows a pie chart of event types
- The Log Severity panel shows a pie chart of log severity levels

### Future Considerations
- Consider creating explicit mappings for Elasticsearch indices to ensure consistent field types
- Update any new dashboards to follow the best practices documented in `elasticsearch_field_mapping.md`
- Consider adding these best practices to the agent onboarding documentation
